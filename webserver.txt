Werbserver: A web server is a software program which serves web pages to web users(browsers). 


    To access web pages of anyt web application you need  a 
    web sever. The web server willl handle all the http requests for the web application.

    Eg: IIL is a web servr for ASP.NET web application and 
    Apach is a web server for PHP or Java web applications

    Node.js provides  capabilities to create your own web server which will handle 
    HTTP requests asynchronously. YOu can use IIS or Apache to 
    run NOde.js web application but it is recommended to use NOde.js webserver.
